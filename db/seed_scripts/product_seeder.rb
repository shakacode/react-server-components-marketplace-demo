      "I've been using this for several months now and I couldn't be happier. The build quality is exceptional and it performs exactly as advertised. The sound quality is crystal clear with deep bass and crisp highs.",
      "After researching dozens of options, I went with this and it was the best decision. The noise cancellation is truly impressive - it blocks out airplane engines, office chatter, and city noise completely.",
      "This is my third pair of premium headphones and by far the best. The comfort level is unmatched - I can wear them for 8+ hours during work without any discomfort. Battery life is insane too.",
      "Bought these for my daily commute and they transformed my experience. The spatial audio feature makes music feel live. Pairing was instant and switching between devices is seamless.",
      "The attention to detail in this product is remarkable. From the premium packaging to the carrying case, everything feels luxury. Sound signature is warm and detailed with excellent instrument separation."
    ],
    4 => [
      "Very good headphones with great sound quality. The only minor issue is that the touch controls can be a bit finicky in cold weather, but otherwise they're excellent for daily use.",
      "Solid build quality and impressive noise cancellation. Battery life exceeds the stated specs. I'd give 5 stars but the app could use some improvements in the EQ customization area.",
      "Great value for premium headphones. The sound is rich and detailed. Comfort is good for the first few hours but my ears do get a bit warm after extended listening sessions.",
      "Really enjoying these. The multipoint connection works flawlessly between my phone and laptop. The mic quality for calls is better than expected. Just wish they folded a bit more compact.",
      "Impressive noise cancellation and sound quality. The transparency mode is natural sounding. Took a star off because the headband could use a tiny bit more padding for all-day wear."
    ],
    3 => [
      "They sound decent and the noise cancellation works, but I expected more at this price point. The bass can be a bit overwhelming with certain genres. Comfort is average.",
      "Good headphones with some caveats. Sound quality is fine for most use cases but audiophiles might want something more refined. The app features are basic compared to competitors.",
      "These are okay. They do what they're supposed to do. The build feels solid but the plastic joints make me wonder about long-term durability. Sound is good but not exceptional.",
      "Mixed feelings about these. The noise cancellation is very effective but introduces a slight hiss. Sound quality improves significantly after adjusting the EQ in the app.",
      "Average product for the price. There are better options available if you're willing to spend a bit more or look at other brands. That said, they're not bad by any means."
    ],
    2 => [
      "Disappointed with the sound quality at this price point. The bass is muddy and the treble sounds harsh at higher volumes. Expected much better from a premium brand.",
      "Build quality feels cheaper than the price suggests. The headband creaks when adjusting, and the ear cups don't rotate enough for comfortable neck rest. Sound is just okay.",
      "Had connectivity issues from day one. Keeps dropping Bluetooth connection randomly. When it works, the sound is decent, but the reliability issues are frustrating.",
      "The noise cancellation creates an uncomfortable pressure sensation in my ears. Sound quality is mediocre - I've heard better from headphones at half the price.",
      "Returned these after a week. The comfort level is poor for anyone with larger ears - the cups are too shallow. Also, the touch controls register phantom touches constantly."
    ],
    1 => [
      "Complete waste of money. Stopped working after two weeks. Customer service was unhelpful and the warranty process is a nightmare. Save your money.",
      "Terrible quality control. Received a unit with a dead right driver. The replacement had buzzing in the left cup. Done trying with this brand.",
      "The worst headphones I've ever owned. Uncomfortable, bad sound, poor noise cancellation. The app is buggy and drains phone battery. Everything about this is bad.",
      "Broke within the first month. The headband snapped at the hinge while carefully taking them off. For the premium price, the build quality is inexcusably poor.",
      "Do not buy these. The advertised 40-hour battery life is a joke - I get maybe 15 hours. Noise cancellation barely works. Sounds like you're listening through a tin can."
